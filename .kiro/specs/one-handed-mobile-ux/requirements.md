4. WHERE screen width is less than 480px, THE Mobile_Interface SHALL stack elements vertically for better readability

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want better visual feedback for interactions, so that I know when I've successfully tapped buttons or completed actions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user taps any interactive element, THE Mobile_Interface SHALL provide immediate visual feedback within 100ms
2. WHILE an action is processing, THE Activity_Tracker SHALL display loading states or progress indicators

4. WHEN an action completes successfully, THE Activity_Tracker SHALL provide confirmation feedback

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want the app to work well in both portrait and landscape orientations, so that I can use it comfortably regardless of how I hold my device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the device orientation changes, THE Mobile_Interface SHALL adapt layout within 300ms
2. WHILE in landscape mode, THE Activity_Tracker SHALL optimize horizontal space usage
3. THE Mobile_Interface SHALL maintain functionality across all supported orientations
4. WHERE orientation changes occur, THE Activity_Tracker SHALL preserve user input and current state

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want improved navigation that's easy to reach with my thumb, so that I can navigate the app comfortably with one hand.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Mobile_Interface SHALL position primary navigation elements within thumb-reach zones
2. WHEN using bottom navigation, THE Activity_Tracker SHALL ensure elements are at least 44px in height
3. WHILE navigating between sections, THE Mobile_Interface SHALL provide smooth transitions
4. WHERE possible, THE Activity_Tracker SHALL minimize the need for top-screen interactions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want better handling of the virtual keyboard, so that input fields remain visible and accessible when typing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the virtual keyboard appears, THE Mobile_Interface SHALL adjust viewport to keep active input visible
2. WHILE typing in input fields, THE Activity_Tracker SHALL prevent content from being obscured
3. THE Mobile_Interface SHALL handle keyboard dismissal gracefully without layout jumps
4. WHERE forms are present, THE Activity_Tracker SHALL provide appropriate keyboard types for each input

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want pull-to-refresh functionality, so that I can easily update my activity data with a natural gesture.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pulling down from the top of the activities list, THE Activity_Tracker SHALL initiate refresh action
2. WHILE refreshing, THE Mobile_Interface SHALL display a loading indicator
3. THE Activity_Tracker SHALL complete refresh operations within 3 seconds under normal conditions
4. WHERE refresh fails, THE Mobile_Interface SHALL display appropriate error messaging

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want swipe gestures for common actions, so that I can quickly perform tasks like editing or deleting activities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN swiping left on an activity item, THE Mobile_Interface SHALL reveal action buttons
