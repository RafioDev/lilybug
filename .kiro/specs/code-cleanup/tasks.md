# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Validate potentially unused components identified in analysis

  - Double-check that ContextualGuidance and DatabaseSetup components have no references
  - Search for any dynamic imports, string references, or conditional usage patterns
  - Verify these components are not used in any configuration files or build scripts
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.3_

- [-] 2. Create backup mechanism before component removal

  - Use git to create a checkpoint before making any changes
  - Document the current state of components being removed
  - _Requirements: 2.2_

- [ ] 3. Remove ContextualGuidance component if confirmed unused

  - Delete the ContextualGuidance.tsx file from src/components directory
  - Verify no TypeScript compilation errors after removal
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.3_

- [ ] 4. Remove DatabaseSetup component if confirmed unused

  - Delete the DatabaseSetup.tsx file from src/components directory
  - Verify no TypeScript compilation errors after removal
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.3_

- [ ] 5. Validate application builds successfully after cleanup

  - Run TypeScript compilation to check for any broken imports
  - Execute the build process to ensure no runtime errors
  - Test that the application starts without errors
  - _Requirements: 2.3_

- [ ] 6. Create component usage analysis script for future cleanups
- [ ] 6.1 Build component scanner utility

  - Write script to scan all files in src/components directory
  - Parse import statements across the entire codebase
  - Generate component usage report
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2_

- [ ] 6.2 Implement dependency mapping

  - Create dependency graph showing component relationships
  - Identify components that only depend on other unused components
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.4_

- [ ]\* 6.3 Add confidence scoring for unused component detection

  - Implement algorithm to score removal safety
  - Account for dynamic imports and runtime references
  - _Requirements: 1.5_

- [ ]\* 6.4 Create automated cleanup validation
  - Write tests to verify component removal safety
  - Add build validation checks
  - _Requirements: 2.3, 2.4_
