# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves analyzing and cleaning up unused components and code in the React application, starting with the `/src/components` directory. The goal is to identify components that are no longer referenced or used in the codebase and safely remove them to reduce bundle size and improve maintainability.

## Glossary

- **Component**: A React functional or class component file in the `/src/components` directory
- **Unused Component**: A component that is not imported or referenced anywhere in the codebase
- **Dead Code**: Code that is written but never executed or referenced
- **Bundle Size**: The total size of the compiled JavaScript application
- **Code Analysis System**: The tooling and process used to identify unused code

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify unused components in the codebase, so that I can reduce bundle size and improve code maintainability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Code Analysis System scans the `/src/components` directory, THE Code Analysis System SHALL identify all component files that are not imported by any other file
2. THE Code Analysis System SHALL generate a report listing all unused components with their file paths
3. THE Code Analysis System SHALL verify that identified components have no dynamic imports or runtime references
4. THE Code Analysis System SHALL exclude components that are only used in development or testing contexts from the unused list
5. THE Code Analysis System SHALL provide confidence levels for each identified unused component

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to safely remove unused components, so that I can clean up the codebase without breaking functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN removing an unused component, THE Code Analysis System SHALL verify the component has no remaining references
2. THE Code Analysis System SHALL create a backup or provide a way to restore removed components
3. THE Code Analysis System SHALL validate that the application still builds successfully after component removal
4. THE Code Analysis System SHALL remove associated test files for deleted components
5. THE Code Analysis System SHALL update any index files or barrel exports that reference the removed components

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to analyze component dependencies, so that I can understand the impact of removing components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Code Analysis System SHALL map all component dependencies and relationships
2. THE Code Analysis System SHALL identify components that are only used by other unused components
3. THE Code Analysis System SHALL detect circular dependencies between components
4. THE Code Analysis System SHALL provide a dependency tree for each component
5. THE Code Analysis System SHALL highlight components with high coupling that might need refactoring
